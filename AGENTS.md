# Prompter Workflow

This project uses Prompter to enhance rough prompts into professional specifications.

## Available Commands

- `/prompter-enhance` - Transform a rough idea into a comprehensive specification

## How It Works

1. Invoke `/prompter-enhance` with your rough idea (e.g., "Create a todo app")
2. The AI will enhance your prompt into a detailed specification
3. The enhanced specification is saved to `prompter/<slug>/enhanced-prompt.md`
4. Use the enhanced specification to guide implementation

## Output Location

Enhanced prompts are saved in the `prompter/` directory:

```
prompter/
├── project.md              # Project context (edit this!)
├── todo-app/
│   └── enhanced-prompt.md  # Enhanced specification
└── ...
```

## Tips

- Edit `prompter/project.md` to provide context about your project
- Be specific in your initial prompt for better results
- Review and refine the enhanced specification before implementing
