# Product Brief: Event Ticketing System (Laravel)

## Project Overview
A web-based **event ticketing** platform built with PHP Laravel. The application provides three distinct interfaces: a **public event browsing** frontend, a **user portal** for ticket holders, and a **custom admin panel** for event/ticket management. It includes QR/barcode-based ticket validation for on-site entry.

> **Note:** This is NOT a transportation ticketing system. It is purpose-built for events (concerts, conferences, festivals, etc.).

---

## 🎨 Design Requirements

### Frontend (Public & User Portal)
- **CSS Framework**: DaisyUI v5 (beta) on Tailwind CSS v4
- **Font**: Plus Jakarta Sans (via `@fontsource`), Spline Sans (user dashboard)
- **Icons**: Material Icons + Material Symbols Outlined + inline SVGs
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary Red: `#e61f27` (public pages, event cards, CTAs)
  - Primary Black: `#101010` (text)
  - Primary White: `#ffffff` (backgrounds)
- **Design Principles**:
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - DaisyUI light/dark theme support (auto via `prefers-color-scheme`)
  - Glassmorphism effects on admin/user portal (backdrop-blur, translucent cards)
  - Three distinct visual modes: public (red-primary), user portal (dark immersive slate), admin (indigo accent with glass cards)

### Admin Panel
- **Framework**: Custom Blade views (NOT Filament)
- **Layout**: Fixed sidebar + top navbar with 3-mode theme switcher (light/dark/system)
- **Accent**: Indigo (`indigo-500`/`indigo-600`) with gradient text effects
- **Glass UI**: `.glass-card` class with `backdrop-blur-xl`

### User Portal
- **Layout**: Desktop sidebar + mobile bottom navigation bar
- **Theme**: Dark immersive (`bg-slate-900`) with glassmorphism
- **Alpine.js**: Used for interactive components (toast notifications, scan mode switcher)

## 👤 User Roles & Access

| Role | Access Level |
|------|-------------|
| `admin` | Full access: all CRUD, user management, system config |
| `staff` | Admin panel access: ticket/event management, history, scan/validate |
| `volunteer` | Scan/validate tickets only |
| `user` | Public browsing, checkout, user portal (tickets, payments, profile) |

Role enforcement is via custom `RoleMiddleware` supporting comma-separated roles and negation (`!`).

---

## 👤 Customer-Facing Features (Implemented)

### 1. Authentication System
- **User Registration**: Email + password, auto-login after registration, rate-limited (3/min)
- **User Login**: Email + password, role-based redirect after login, rate-limited (5/min)
- **Password Reset**: Forgot password flow via email token
- **Logout**: Session invalidation + regeneration
- **Activity Logging**: Login, logout, and failed login attempts are auto-logged with IP/user-agent

> **Not implemented**: Social auth (Google/Facebook), email verification enforcement, "Remember me", phone verification

### 2. Event Discovery
- **Public Event Listing**: Paginated grid (9 per page) of published events
- **Event Detail Page**: Full event info with venue, organizer, available ticket types
- **Visibility Control**: Only `published` events shown publicly; admin/staff can preview unpublished

> **Not implemented**: Search/filter by category, date, price range, location. No autocomplete. No sorting options.

### 3. Checkout / Ticket Purchase
- **Ticket Type Selection**: Choose from available ticket types (e.g., VIP, Standard, GA)
- **Quantity Selection**: Purchase 1–10 tickets per transaction
- **Pessimistic Locking**: `lockForUpdate()` prevents overselling during concurrent purchases
- **Immediate Confirmation**: Tickets issued with `status=issued`, `payment_status=confirmed` (no actual payment gateway)
- **Success Page**: Displays purchased ticket details with UUID

> **Not implemented**: Step-by-step wizard, seat selection during checkout, promo codes, payment gateway, booking expiration timer

### 4. User Portal (Dashboard)
- **Dashboard Stats**: Active ticket count, pending payments, total loyalty points
- **My Tickets**: List with upcoming/past tabs (filtered by event start time), paginated (12)
- **Ticket Detail**: View ticket info with QR code + barcode
- **My Payments**: Payment list (paginated 10) + detail view
- **Profile Management**: Edit name, email, phone, avatar (1MB max). Password change with current password verification.
- **Testimonials**: Submit rating (1–5) + comment for past events. Awards 10 loyalty points. One review per event per user.
- **Activity History**: View own activity logs with filters (action type, date range), paginated (25)

> **Not implemented**: E-ticket PDF download from user side, booking cancellation, saved passengers, notification preferences, payment method management

### 5. Ticket Scanning & Validation
- **QR/Barcode Scanner**: Camera-based scanning UI (Alpine.js) for on-site entry validation
- **Manual Entry**: Barcode code or UUID text input
- **Validation Logic**: Checks ticket exists → checks not already scanned → marks as scanned with timestamp
- **Duplicate Detection**: Already-scanned tickets return `duplicate` status
- **Validated Tickets List**: View all scanned tickets, paginated (20)
- **Access**: Admin, staff, and volunteer roles

## 📊 Database Schema (Actual)

### Core Tables (11)
| Table | Key Columns | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `users` | name, email, password, role, phone, avatar, email_verified_at | All user accounts (admin/staff/volunteer/user) |
| `events` | name, slug, description, start_time, end_time, status, venue_id, organizer_id, image | Event definitions |
| `venues` | name, description, address, city, state, country, postal_code, capacity | Event locations |
| `seats` | venue_id, section, row, number, type, status | Individual seats within venues |
| `organizers` | user_id, name, email, phone, website, description | Event organizer profiles |
| `ticket_types` | event_id, name, description, price, quantity, sold, sale_start_date, sale_end_date | Ticket pricing tiers per event |
| `tickets` | uuid, secure_token, user_id, event_id, ticket_type_id, seat_id, barcode, status, payment_status, scanned_at | Individual issued tickets |
| `payments` | user_id, amount, status, payment_method, transaction_id | Payment records |
| `payment_tickets` | payment_id, ticket_id | Many-to-many pivot |
| `testimonials` | user_id, event_id, ticket_id, rating, comment | User reviews for past events |
| `loyalty_points` | user_id, points, source, description | Points earned from actions (e.g., testimonials) |
| `activity_logs` | user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, metadata, description, ip_address, user_agent | Polymorphic audit trail |

### Key Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: Venue → Events, Event → TicketTypes, Event → Tickets, User → Tickets, User → Payments
- **Many-to-Many**: Payment ↔ Ticket (via `payment_tickets`)
- **Belongs-To**: Ticket → TicketType, Ticket → Event, Ticket → User, Ticket → Seat, Event → Venue, Event → Organizer, Organizer → User
- **Polymorphic**: ActivityLog → any model (via `resource_type`/`resource_id`)
- **Has-Many**: User → Testimonials, User → LoyaltyPoints, User → ActivityLogs

### Legacy Fields on Tickets
The `tickets` table retains `user_name`, `user_email`, `seat_number`, `type` as legacy columns for backward compatibility. Normalized versions use `user_id`, `seat_id`, and `ticket_type_id` foreign keys.

## 🔒 Security (Implemented)

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Custom authentication controller with rate limiting (IP-based)
   - CSRF protection on all forms (Blade `@csrf` directives)
   - Role-based middleware (`RoleMiddleware`) with multi-role and negation support
   - Policy-based authorization (`TicketPolicy`, `PaymentPolicy`, `TicketTypePolicy`)

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Eloquent ORM (SQL injection prevention)
   - Blade templating (XSS protection via `{{ }}` escaping)
   - Input validation on all forms (Form Requests + inline validation)
   - Password hashing (bcrypt via Laravel)
   - Session invalidation on logout

3. **Ticket Security**:
   - UUID-based ticket identification
   - `secure_token` for additional verification
   - CRC32-based deterministic barcode generation
   - Pessimistic locking during checkout to prevent race conditions

> **Not implemented**: HTTPS enforcement config, encryption at rest for PII, JWT/API tokens, PCI DSS compliance, payment tokenization

## ⚡ Architecture & Patterns

### Backend
- **Layout**: `@extends`/`@section`/`@yield` Blade inheritance (3 layouts + 1 user portal layout)
- **Activity Logging**: `LogsActivity` trait auto-logs Eloquent create/update/delete events; `ActivityLogger` service for manual logging
- **Auth Event Listeners**: `LogSuccessfulLogin`, `LogSuccessfulLogout`, `LogFailedLogin`
- **Services**: `BarcodeService` (QR + Code128), `ActivityLogger`
- **Validation**: Form Request classes for ticket types; inline validation elsewhere
- **PDF Generation**: DomPDF for ticket export

### Frontend
- **Build**: Vite 7 with Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI v5
- **JS**: Alpine.js (CDN, user portal), vanilla JS (admin theme switcher, sidebar)
- **CSS**: Single entry point (`resources/css/app.css`) with Tailwind v4 config
- **Interactivity**: Camera-based barcode scanning, form validation, toast notifications

- Factory chain: Ticket → TicketType → Event → Venue + Organizer
- No soft deletes on any model
- Event slug auto-generation with collision handling in model `booted()` method

---

## 🎯 Current Project Status

### Fully Functional
- Authentication (login, register, password reset, logout)
- Public event browsing and detail pages
- Ticket checkout with oversell protection
- User portal (dashboard, tickets, payments, profile, testimonials)
- Admin panel (events, venues, seats, organizers, ticket types, tickets, users, history)
- QR/barcode ticket scanning and validation
- PDF ticket export
- Comprehensive activity audit logging
- Loyalty points (via testimonials)
- Role-based access control (4 roles)

### MVP Limitations
- No real payment processing (immediate confirmation)
- No search/filter/sort on event listing
- No email notifications sent
- Limited test coverage (~20%)
- No API layer
- `user/dashboard.blade.php` is standalone (doesn't extend user layout — inconsistency)
