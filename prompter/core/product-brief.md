# Writing Standards
- **Tone:** Confident, data-informed, strategic
- **Length:** Comprehensive but scannable (typically 200-400 lines)
- **Language:** Executive-friendly, minimal jargon
- **Visuals:** Use tables for structured data, ASCII diagrams for flows/architecture
- **Icons:** Use emoji icons (⏱️, ✅, 📊, 🔐, 📁, 🔄, 1️⃣, 2️⃣, etc.) to improve scannability
- **Checkmarks:** Use ✅ for features/advantages, ❌ for competitor disadvantages

# Quality Criteria
1. A busy executive can understand the product in under 5 minutes
2. The value proposition is immediately clear from the first sections
3. Tables make data comparison easy and quick to scan
4. Visual diagrams help explain system architecture and workflows
5. Competitive positioning is explicit and easy to understand
6. Technical and non-technical stakeholders can both extract value

# Special Instructions
- If information is incomplete, make reasonable assumptions and mark with [ASSUMPTION] or use placeholder text like [TBD]
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness
- Lead with impact, not features
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Avoid superlatives without supporting data
- If competitive information is sparse, focus on unique value rather than comparisons
- Adapt section headers to match the product domain (e.g., "Financial Features" for fintech, "Clinical Workflow" for healthcare)
- Skip sections that don't apply to the product type (e.g., "Technical Foundation" for non-software products)
