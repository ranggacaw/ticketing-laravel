# 🧠 Epic: Internal Ticket Barcode Generation System

### 🎯 Epic Goal
We need to develop an **Internal Ticket Barcode Generation System** in order for **ticketing administrators** to **efficiently create compliant, valid tickets with specific user details** that seamlessly integrate with our existing external scanning infrastructure.

### 🚀 Definition of Done
- [x] System generates unique, scannable barcodes corresponding to ticket records.
- [x] Add users and User interface allows entry and management of seat number, ticket type, price, and user details.
- [x] Generated outputs (digital or print) clearly display the barcode alongside readable ticket details.
- [x] Barcodes are verified to be 100% compatible with the existing external scanner hardware/software.
- [x] System handles validation to prevent duplicate seat assignments or invalid data entries.

### 📌 High-Level Scope (Included)
- **Barcode Generation Engine**: Logic to create barcodes (e.g., QR, Code128) encoding necessary validation data.
- **Ticket Management Interface**: Admin dashboard to input and manage user/ticket specific data (Seat, Price, Type).
- **Export/Preview Module**: Functionality to view and export the final ticket design with the barcode.
- **Data Integration Layer**: ensuring the data structure matches what the external scanner expects.

### ❌ Out of Scope
- **Hardware Procurement**: Acquiring new scanners (must work with existing).
- **Customer-Facing Portal**: This is strictly an internal tool for staff.
- **Payment Processing**: Handling actual payments for the tickets (focus is on generation/fulfillment).

### 📁 Deliverables
- **Web-based Admin Dashboard** for ticket creation.
- **Barcode Generator Service** (API or internal library).
- **Ticket Template Design** (HTML/PDF format).
- **Technical Documentation** detailing barcode formats verification.

### 🧩 Dependencies
- **External Scanner Documentation**: precise specifications (symbology, data string format) of the current scanning system.

### ⚠️ Risks / Assumptions
- **Risk**: The external scanner might use an encrypted or proprietary format we cannot easily replicate without vendor tailored keys.
- **Assumption**: The external system supports standard barcode symbologies (QR, Code128, etc.).
- **Assumption**: Staff users will have access to a standard web browser to access this system.

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- **Scan Success Rate**: 99.9% of generated tickets are successfully read by external scanners.
- **Generation Speed**: Time to create and generate a single ticket is under 5 seconds.
- **Error Rate**: Zero incidents of duplicate seat collision generated by the system.
