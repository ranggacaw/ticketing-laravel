Develop a ticketing application prototype focused on design and routing functionalities, without implementing backend processing or barcode scanning logic. The app should allow users to input or capture a barcode (via camera scanning or manual entry simulation) and display a mock output of the decoded information. Ensure the interface supports common barcode formats (e.g., QR codes, UPC, EAN) but only demonstrates navigation flows and UI elements for now.

Key features to include are:
- A user-friendly interface optimized for both mobile and tablet platforms.
- Mock screens for barcode entry, scanning, and result display.
- Routing functionality demonstrating navigation between pages (e.g., Home → Scan Barcode → Decoded Information/Errors).
- Clickable elements to simulate the app flow, such as buttons and navigation links.

Clarify the platform for deployment (e.g., iOS, Android, web) and recommend tools and libraries for the prototype (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Figma). Deliverables should include wireframes or a prototype showcasing the design, complete routing, and functional navigation without backend logic. this project using laravel and tailwindcss for style guidlines
